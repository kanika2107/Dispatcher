Object per connection socket:
* socket fd
* buffer
* processing policy

Object per listening socket (templated on what type of new connection objects):
* Reference to dispatcher object
* socket fd
* Constructor (will need an address/port number): call socket/bind/listen
* HandleRead:
** We got a new connection, so we:
** Call accept
** Create a new connection object
** Call dispatcher's register method

Dispatcher object (one per thread):
* fdsets to pass to select
* Map of fds to socket handler objects
* register method
* Main event loop (run method) that
** Calls select
** Sees what fds are available for reading
** Calls methods in listening/connection socket objects
** Does not normally return

Will add more later
